A tool to ease contributions to opam repositories.

Opam-publish helps gather metadata to form an OPAM package and submit it
to a remote repository. This is in a preliminary state, and currently you
can only submit to github-hosted repos using pull-requests (a more generic
backend using `format-patch` is planned).
